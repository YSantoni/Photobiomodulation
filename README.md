# Photobiomodulation
An exploration into photobiomodulation possibilities

*Photobiomodulation* or *Low-level laser therapy* (LLLT) has a wavelengthdependent capability to alter cellular behavior in the absence of significant thermal effects. To date, LLLT has been used for therapeutic purposes in treating wound healing, musculoskeletal pain and dental diseases. Some studies have examined the effects of LLLT in augmenting the regeneration of various tissues such as skin, bone, skeletal muscle and nerve. Cellular functions are altered by LLLT irradiation, which include an increase in protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, cell motility, membrane potential, binding affinities, neurotransmitter release, phagocytosis, ATP synthesis and prostaglandin synthesis. But there are no established mechanisms by which these alterations occur. Components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain exhibit frequency- dependent spectra of the action, which leads to the speculation that the respiratory chain plays a vital role in the effects of LLLT. Furthermore, light at certain wavelenght seems to have an effect on intramitochondrial water viscosity gradients which would be an other mechanism of action of near-infrared and infrared light on ATP synthase, the smallest known rotary motor in nature, and helping it operates at higher efficiencies.
