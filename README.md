# Photobiomodulation
An exploration into photobiomodulation possibilities

*Photobiomodulation* or *Low-level laser therapy* (LLLT) is a form of medicine that applies low-level lasers or light-emitting diodes to the surface of the body. 

It has a wavelengthdependent capability to alter cellular behavior in the absence of significant thermal effects. To date, LLLT has been used for therapeutic purposes in treating wound healing, musculoskeletal pain and dental diseases. Some studies have examined the effects of LLLT in augmenting the regeneration of various tissues such as skin, bone, skeletal muscle and nerve. Cellular functions are altered by LLLT irradiation, which include an increase in protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, cell motility, membrane potential, binding affinities, neurotransmitter release, phagocytosis, ATP synthesis and prostaglandin synthesis. But there are no established mechanisms by which these alterations occur. Components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain exhibit frequency- dependent spectra of the action, which leads to the speculation that the respiratory chain plays a vital role in the effects of LLLT. Furthermore, light at certain wavelenght seems to have an effect on intramitochondrial water viscosity gradients which would be an other mechanism of action of near-infrared and infrared light on ATP synthase, the smallest known rotary motor in nature, and helping it operates at higher efficiencies.

To explore the possibilities of LLLT, we propose a system consisting of multiple light emmitting diodes (LED) of wavelenght in the 657nm range, 727 nm range and 860nm range embedded in a hockey cup and working on a rechargeable battery.
The goal is to study the effects of near infrared light on the testis, and subsequently the effect on testosterone levels and fertility.
Such a device should be known as *The FireBall*

## The Fireball
A first proof of concept was built using two high power LED, called *NASA LED* because used by NASA to make plants grow in space since 1995, and emitting wavelenght of 660nm.

Two participant, males between 29 and 31, used the device 30 min per day just before sleep. We observed a 18.5% increase in total testosterone levels in one participant after 3 weeks of this protocol. We observed a 9.6% in the other participant after 1 week. Those anecdotal evidence that something is maybe working as expeted prompted the realisation of a more advanced prototype: *The FireBall*

## Monitoring Testosterone levels
Not viable via blood sampling, we need to find an other way to monitor the testosterone levels evolution day by day.
### Testosterone levels proxies
There are severals, but Nocturnal penile tumescence seems to have linear relation with free testosterone levels in the body, regardless of age.
### The FireSword
A system for Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) tracking using a purpose-built pressure sensor in the shape of a ring and a datalogger.
